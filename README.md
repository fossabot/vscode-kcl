Other useful features such as refactoring and testing are in development.

## Dependencies

We recommend that you use the latest version of KCLVM, but the minimum required version for this extension is 0.4.6. If you are using an earlier version, the extension may not work properly.

## Known Issues

- **Hover and GotoDefintion:** The current hover and goto definitions are similar to global search, and there may be multiple results for some Identifiers with the same name.
- **Completion:** Currently, we only support keyword completion and dot-triggered completion (e.g., `schema.attr`, `pkg.schema` and `str.methods` ). Full semantic completion is in development.
